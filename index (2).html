    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

    <h2>Reading</h2>

    <p>I love reading mystery and science fiction books. <br>
    Some of my favorite author include Agatha Christie and Issac Asimov. <br>
    I usually read for an hour before bed each night.</p>

    <h2>Sports</h2>

    <p></p>I enjoy playing soccer and basketball during weekend. <br>
    I play soccer with my friends at the park every Saturday. <br>
    On Sundays, I join a local basketball team for a game at the community center.</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>

    <p>I like listening to music and jazz while studying. <br>
        My favorite composers are Mozart and Beethoven, and I love Miles Davies for jazz. <br>
        I often attend live music performances in my city when i get the chance.
